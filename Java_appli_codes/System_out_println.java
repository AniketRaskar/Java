//About system.out.println()
/*
  class System
  {
    public static PrintStream out = new PrintStream();
  }

  class PrintStream
  {
    public void println(String str)
    {

    }
  }

  System.out.println();


  System is a static class conatains in java.lang package which can be access by class name, which contains oject of printstream class as out, and that printstream class contains method named println which takes input string and prints it

  In this way system.out.println() works
